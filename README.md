This project includes a NodeJS server capable of executing a subset of IMAP commands to showcase a voulnurability in the IMAP protocol relating to inconsistent UID values across server sessions due to the undefined nature of a "mailbox session" in the latest protocol revision. To begin, run the server using `npm run dev` or `npm run start`. To execute the mock client calls, execute `npm run exploit`. Both starting the server and running the exploit require compiling the code with `npm run build`.
